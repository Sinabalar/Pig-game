# Pig-game
simple pig game for fun
Hi...
This is a simple pig game that I made with JavaScript
you can play it with your friend 
every time you roll the dice it gave you a number between 1 to 6 as you know
If the value of the dice that showen to you is not 1 then the value of the current dice is added to your current score
but if it's value was 1 your current score was go down to 0 and your friend become active player to roll the dice
Every time if the dice value is not 1 you have 2 option: 1.Hold the current score 2.Roll the dice again
1.Hold the current score: If you do hold the cureent score the vlue of current score is transfer to the main score and your friend become active player to roll the dice
2.Roll the dice again: you can roll the dice as much as you like and you can if the vlaue are not 1 so be careful...:)
Eventually if the active player main score are 100 or much is the winner
